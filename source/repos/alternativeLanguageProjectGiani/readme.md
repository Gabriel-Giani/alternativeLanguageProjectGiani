Which programming language and version did you pick?

Answer: C# 8.0

Why did you pick this programming language?

Answer: I picked this programming language because it is a language that is fairly similar to C++ and I wanted to try and use it to do this project.
C# is a very powerful language and it is fairly easy to use. It is very fast and has a lot of libraries that can be used to solve a lot of different problems.
C# is also a very popular language and it is used by a lot of companies to develop software which made it a good option for me since learning it could prove useful in the future.

How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling.
If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

Answer: 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
C# is an object-oriented that supports the core principles of OOP which are abstract data types, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Classes and objects are used as the primary structures for organizing code.
C# supports interfacing and abstract classes, allowing for flexible design patterns.

File Ingestion:
C# provides support for file input and output through namespaces like System.IO. This includes the ability to read/write to and from files, handle binary and text files, and utilize streams for data processing.

Conditional Statements:
C# supports conditional statements such as if, else if, else, and switch. These structures allow developers to control the flow of execution.

Assignment Statements:
Assignment operators in C# are supported, using the = operator to assign values to variables and compound assignment operators like +=, -=, etc.

Loops:
C# supports several types of loops for repeated execution of code. These include for, foreach, while, and do-while loops, for different scenarios depending on the requirements.

Subprograms (Functions/Methods):
C# supports both static and instance methods, and you can define methods with access levels and parameters. Overloading and overriding methods are also supported for further functionality.

Unit Testing:
C# supports unit testing through various frameworks, with MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit.net. These frameworks allow developers to write test cases to ensure that code behaves as expected.

Exception Handling:
Exception handling in C# is supported, using try, catch, finally, and throw blocks. Exception handling allows developers to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the application can recover from unexpected issues without crashing.


Answer: C# is a very powerful language that supports all of the features mentioned above.


List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.

Answer: The one library I used from my programming language is CSVHelper. I used this library to read the csv file and convert it to a list of objects more easily.
I chose this library because it is very easy to use and it is very fast. I used it to read the csv file and convert it to a list of objects.
